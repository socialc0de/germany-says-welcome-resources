"Germany Says Welcome" uses phrasebook data from the fellow project [Refugee Phrasebook](http://www.refugeephrasebook.de).
 This project maintains a phrasebook with common and useful phrases in many languages. The data is kept in a
 Google docs spreadsheet with one phrase per row. 
 
 To make use of the data, "Germany Says Welcome" exports the phrasebook to JSON and imports the data into the API data 
 model. To export the data, we developed a Google App Script for https://script.google.com 
 which can be deployed as a Web-App. 
 
<b>Note: The export script is very slow and takes at least 3 minutes to return something.</b>
